# Hello

I'm ErickRen, University Student, Developer, .

I firmly believe that science and technology can change the world.

I'm crazy about Games, such as Minecraft, CS:GO and Genshin Impact,I learn to code beacuse of Minecraft.

I like watch VTuber live.I like the [星宮汐](https://twitter.com/Hosimiya_Sio),[Alice Mana](https://twitter.com/Alicemana_v) and [兎田ぺこら](https://twitter.com/usadapekora) best,and now I have probably followed over 50 Vtubers and Vups....

I think technology should promote human happiness rather than become a tool for wealth.
