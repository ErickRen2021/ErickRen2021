# Hello

I'm ErickRen,a high school student from China.

# What kind of person am I?

I like Java,Go,Python and .Net Framework.

I firmly believe that science and technology can change the world.

I'm crazy about Games,like Minecraft,CS:GO and Genshin Impact,I learn to code beacuse of Minecraft.

I like watch VTuber live.I like the [星宮汐](https://twitter.com/Hosimiya_Sio),[Alice Mana](https://twitter.com/Alicemana_v) and [兎田ぺこら](https://twitter.com/usadapekora) best,and now I have probably followed over 50 Vtubers and Vups....

I think technology should promote human happiness rather than become a tool for wealth.
